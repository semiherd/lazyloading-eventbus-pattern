Modular Plugin Architecture – add/remove plugins easily

Lazy Loading – images/icons loaded only when visible via Intersection Observer.

Safe Initialization – Accessibility plugin subscribes only after all elements are rendered.

Destroy Methods – all plugins can remove event listeners cleanly to avoid memory leaks.

Event Bus - By Encapsulating and Isolating Event Bus Class we can create Custom Event Bus Implementation on the wrapper which makes it more scalable in need of more complex Event Handling
